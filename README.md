# 🔊 Voice Calculator

An interactive voice-enabled calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations using **speech recognition**. This project enhances accessibility and simplifies calculations through a clean UI and real-time voice input processing.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ Voice Recognition for Arithmetic Commands  
- 🧮 Basic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
- 📊 Dynamic Graph Plotting for Mathematical Functions  
- 🖥️ Real-time UI Updates  
- 🎨 User-friendly Interface with Responsive Design

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – Speech recognition and logic implementation  
- **PHP** – Backend placeholder (optional; use for future data handling)

## 📂 Project Structure

├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
├── graph.js (optional)
├── functions.php (optional)


## 🧠 How It Works

1. User clicks the **microphone** icon.
2. JavaScript captures voice input using `SpeechRecognition` API.
3. Converts speech to text and parses the arithmetic expression.
4. Displays the result instantly.
5. If a mathematical function is mentioned (like `plot sin x`), it renders a graph using a canvas/charting library.

## 🖱️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/githubsagarkumar/Voice-calculator.git
   cd Voice-calculator
Open index.html in a browser (preferably Chrome for best Speech API support).

Click on the 🎤 mic icon and speak a command:

Examples:

"What is 12 plus 7?"

"Calculate 50 divided by 5"

"Plot sine x"

View the result instantly on the screen.

📌 Future Improvements
Add support for advanced math operations (square roots, exponents, etc.)

Integrate language localization

Store history using localStorage or backend DB

Dark mode toggle and accessibility themes
